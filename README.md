# _Survey to Return Course of Study Track Suggestion at Epicodus_

#### _This webpage suggests a course of study for a beginning programmer based upon 5 responses provided by the user, 2018.10.19_

#### By _**Christopher Thomas Cahill**_

## Description

_This webpage shows and hides a survey. Based upon a simple branching and point-awarding method, a number of if/else statements provide a userScore for the user, based upon their provided responses via the drop-down menus. In an interesting way, the user select the button to 'show' the survey, then 'submit' the survey, then 'remove' the survey (via another button), and then when the survey is 'shown' again, the previous response from the webpage will have disappeared -- and then the user may 'submit' another set of responses and then retrieve another, different suggestion as a response, based upon different responses provided._
